## Introduction

Welcome to my Leetcode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various Leetcode problems as well as some additional practice problems that I have worked on.

## Solutions

You can find my solutions to Leetcode problems in the `leet` directory. Each solution is organized by problem number, in its own folder. Most of them have a problem description in a README file in their respective folders. Some of them also include a description of the method used to solve the problem.

## Practice Problems

In addition to Leetcode problems, I have also included some practice problems that I have worked on. These can be found in the `practice` directory.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-solutions.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
